  abstract  = {The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance-deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.},

One important problem is automatically detecting the cellular compartment where a fluorescently-tagged protein resides, a task relatively simple for an experienced human, but difficult to automate on a computer. Here, we train an 11-layer neural network on data from mapping thousands of yeast proteins, achieving per cell localization classification accuracy of 91\%, and per protein accuracy of 99\% on held-out images. We confirm that low-level network features correspond to basic image characteristics, while deeper layers separate localization classes. Using this network as a feature calculator, we train standard classifiers that assign proteins to previously unseen compartments after observing only a small number of training examples. Our results are the most accurate subcellular localization classifications to date, and demonstrate the usefulness of deep learning for high-throughput microscopy.},

  abstract  = {Modeling the properties and functions of DNA sequences is an important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics. This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function. A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and 93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory 'grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers, DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related models. We have made the source code available at the github repository http://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.},

Non-sequential models such as SVMs or feed-forward neural networks are often used although they have no natural way of handling sequences of varying length. Recurrent neural networks such as the long short term memory (LSTM) model on the other hand are designed to handle sequences. In this study we demonstrate that LSTM networks predict the subcellular location of proteins given only the protein sequence with high accuracy (0.902) outperforming current state of the art algorithms. We further improve the performance by introducing convolutional filters and experiment with an attention mechanism which lets the LSTM focus on specific parts of the protein. Lastly we introduce new visualizations of both the convolutional filters and the attention mechanisms and show how they can be used to extract biologically relevant knowledge from the LSTM networks.},

  abstract = {{The prediction of eukaryotic protein subcellular localization is a well-studied topic in bioinformatics due to its relevance in proteomics research. Many machine learning methods have been successfully applied in this task, but in most of them, predictions rely on annotation of homologues from knowledge databases. For novel proteins where no annotated homologues exist, and for predicting the effects of sequence variants, it is desirable to have methods for predicting protein properties from sequence information only.Here, we present a prediction algorithm using deep neural networks to predict protein subcellular localization relying only on sequence information. At its core, the prediction model uses a recurrent neural network that processes the entire protein sequence and an attention mechanism identifying protein regions important for the subcellular localization. The model was trained and tested on a protein dataset extracted from one of the latest UniProt releases, in which experimentally annotated proteins follow more stringent criteria than previously. We demonstrate that our model achieves a good accuracy (78\\% for 10 categories; 92\\% for membrane-bound or soluble), outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms, including those relying on homology information.The method is available as a web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc.

  abstract  = {MOTIVATION: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical for virtually every biological function. Recently, researchers suggested to use supervised learning for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. However, its performance is largely restricted by the availability of truly interacting proteins (labeled). Meanwhile, there exists a considerable amount of protein pairs where an association appears between two partners, but not enough experimental evidence to support it as a direct interaction (partially labeled). RESULTS: We propose a semi-supervised multi-task framework for predicting PPIs from not only labeled, but also partially labeled reference sets. The basic idea is to perform multi-task learning on a supervised classification task and a semi-supervised auxiliary task. The supervised classifier trains a multi-layer perceptron network for PPI predictions from labeled examples. The semi-supervised auxiliary task shares network layers of the supervised classifier and trains with partially labeled examples. Semi-supervision could be utilized in multiple ways. We tried three approaches in this article, (i) classification (to distinguish partial positives with negatives); (ii) ranking (to rate partial positive more likely than negatives); (iii) embedding (to make data clusters get similar labels). We applied this framework to improve the identification of interacting pairs between HIV-1 and human proteins. Our method improved upon the state-of-the-art method for this task indicating the benefits of semi-supervised multi-task learning using auxiliary information.

Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications. RESULTS: We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.

Atomistic simulations cannot cover the relevant spatiotemporal scales at which the cellular processes occur. To address this challenge, coarse-grained (CG) modeling of the biological systems is employed. Over the last few years, many CG models for proteins continue to be developed. However, many of them are not transferable with respect to different systems and different environments. In this review, we discuss those CG protein models that are transferable and that retain chemical specificity. We restrict ourselves to CG models of soluble proteins only.

In response to NTP binding, the TL undergoes large conformational changes to switch between distinct open and closed states to tighten the active site and avail catalysis. A computational strategy for characterizing the conformational transition pathway is presented to bridge the open and closed states of the TL. Information from a large number of independent all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories from Hamiltonian replica exchange and targeted molecular dynamics simulations is gathered together to assemble a connectivity map of the conformational transition. The results show that with a cognate NTP, TL closing should be a spontaneous process. One major intermediate state is identified along the conformational transition pathway, and the key structural features are characterized. The complete pathway from the open TL to the closed TL provides a clear picture of the TL closing.},

However, development, production and quality control of antibodies is expensive and time consuming. To circumvent these difficulties, three peptides were derived from complementarity determining regions of an antibody heavy chain against influenza A spike glycoprotein. Their binding properties were studied experimentally, and by molecular dynamics simulations. Two peptide candidates showed binding to influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2. One of them, termed PeB, with the highest affinity prevented binding to and infection of target cells in the micromolar region without any cytotoxic effect. PeB matches best the conserved receptor binding site of hemagglutinin. PeB bound also to other medical relevant influenza strains, such as human-pathogenic A/California/7/2009 H1N1, and avian-pathogenic A/Mute Swan/Rostock/R901/2006 H7N1. Strategies to improve the affinity and to adapt specificity are discussed and exemplified by a double amino acid substituted peptide, obtained by substitutional analysis.

The new swine flu virus is actually a genetic mixture of two strains, both found in swine, of unknown origin. S-OIV can be transmitted from human to human and causes the normal symptoms of influenza. Prevention of swine influenza spread among humans includes use of standard infection control measures against influenza and constitutes the main scope of World Health Organization. For the treatment of S-OIV influenza oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in most cases. Prophylaxis against this new flu strain is expected through a new vaccine, which is not available yet. Worldwide extension of S-OIV is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and indicates that response actions against S-OIV must be aggressive.},

Kadam et al. tested the cell entry stage of the virus life cycle as a drug target (see the Perspective by Whitehead). Cell entry is mediated by the major surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). This stage can be blocked by broadly neutralizing antibodies binding to HA. The authors generated small cyclic peptides that bind to the same sites on HA as the antibodies and mimic their activity. The peptides are cheap and easy to synthesize, are nontoxic to mice, and prevented infection of cells by many types of influenza virus.Science, this issue p. 496; see also p. 450Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent peptidic inhibitors of influenza hemagglutinin. The peptide design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized peptides exhibit nanomolar affinity and neutralization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The peptide inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH{\textendash}induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These peptidic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule{\textendash} and peptide-based therapeutics against influenza virus.},

  abstract  = {Tungsten can coordinate one, two, or three alkyne ligands, and certain of its bis-alkyne complexes are air stable. This chemistry has been explored as a means for constraining peptides to either ?-turns or ?-sheets. To determine whether two peptides coordinated to tungsten would hydrogen-bond in the manner of a ?-sheet, peptides bearing a single alkyne at either the N- or C-terminus were used to form tungsten bis-alkynylpeptide complexes (3, 4a-b, 5a-b, 6 and 7). It was found that in these complexes the two peptides do not hydrogen-bond with each other to form a ?-sheet; rather at 23?C the two alkynylpeptide ligands rotate about the tungsten center to generate syn- and anti-orientations that are in equilibrium. Similarly, symmetrical peptide derivatives incorporating 1,4-dihydroxy-2-butyne, when coordinated to tungsten as mono-alkyne complexes (11a-c, 12 and 13), did not hydrogen-bond with each other or with themselves to generate a ?-sheet structure. However, coordination of peptides incorporating 2-amino-2'-carboxydiphenylacetylene (14 and 15), which are known to adopt a ?-sheet conformation, to tungsten as mono-alkyne complexes (16a-b and 17a-b), did maintain the ?-sheet structure. Current work to generate ?-sheet structures revolves around a recently discovered cyclic ferrocene tungsten bis-alkyne complex (25), that limits the two alkyne ligands to only the syn orientation. Peptide derivatives of 25, where the peptides are linked to the two alkyne ligands (27a-b?31a-b, and 32 and 33), are under investigation. The ability of tungsten alkyne coordination to induce turn conformations was explored using metallacyclicpeptides, where coordination of a single tungsten to two alkynes positioned at two different locations on a single peptide was used to form a ring system incorporating the tungsten metal; such molecules are called metallacyclicpeptides. Cyclization of dipeptides bearing an alkyne on each amino acid (22?24), failed to limit the peptide to a turn conformation, but cyclization of tri- and tetrapeptides bearing alkynes at their N- and C-termini (20 and 21), did generate turn structures.},

RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring mechanism for gene silencing induced by the presence of short interfering RNA (siRNA). RNAi is an endogenous catalytic pathway that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The trigger can occur naturally, as in the case of a cellular infection by a dsRNA virus, or by the intentional introduction of dsRNA to induce user-directed degradation of the cognate transcript(s). RNAi is fundamentally a two-step process. The first step involves the master enzyme in the RNAi process, a type III endoribonuclease aptly named Dicer. This enzyme is involved in the ATP-dependent digestion of longer dsRNA into 21 to 23 bp siRNA molecules with characteristic 3? dinucleotide overhangs on both strands. In the second step, siRNA, regardless of the source, becomes part of a multicomponent RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The use of RNAi as a means of studying the effects of gene expression in a cell or in an organism is occasionally called reverse genetics, the goal of which is to determine the consequences for a cell when a protein is not produced. In other words, the function of a gene can often be discovered by silencing it. The overall RNAi efficiency in an experiment is also a function of the abundance and the stability of both the target mRNA and the encoded protein, and the precise region of the mRNA targeted for scission.},

On the molecular level, RNA interference is mediated by a family of ribonucleoprotein complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), which can be programmed to target virtually any nucleic acid sequence for silencing. The ability of RISC to locate target RNAs has been co-opted by evolution many times to generate a broad spectrum of gene-silencing pathways. Here, we review the fundamental biochemical and biophysical properties of RISC that facilitate gene targeting and describe the various mechanisms of gene silencing known to exploit RISC activity.},

At every time step a new firefighter may be placed on some vertex, and then the fire advances to every vertex that is not protected by a firefighter and has a neighbor on fire. The problem is notoriously hard: it is NP-hard even when the input graph is a bipartite graph or a tree of maximum degree 3, it is NP-hard to approximate within n1-? for any ?>0, and it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of saved vertices. We show that Firefighter can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs, split graphs, permutation graphs, and Pk-free graphs for fixed k. To complement these results, we show that the problem remains NP-hard on unit disk graphs.},

  abstract  = {Numerous approaches study the vulnerability of networks against social contagion. Graph burning studies how fast a contagion, modeled as a set of fires, spreads in a graph. The burning process takes place in synchronous, discrete rounds. In each round, a fire breaks out at a vertex, and the fire spreads to all vertices that are adjacent to a burning vertex. The selection of vertices where fires start defines a schedule that indicates the number of rounds required to burn all vertices. Given a graph, the objective of an algorithm is to find a schedule that minimizes the number of rounds to burn graph. Finding the optimal schedule is known to be NP-hard, and the problem remains NP-hard when the graph is a tree or a set of disjoint paths. The only known algorithm is an approximation algorithm for disjoint paths, which has an approximation ratio of 1.5.We present approximation algorithms for graph burning. For general graphs, we introduce an algorithm with an approximation ratio of 3. When the graph is a tree, we present another algorithm with approximation ratio 2. Moreover, we consider a setting where the graph is a forest of disjoint paths. In this setting, when the number of paths is constant, we provide an optimal algorithm which runs in polynomial time. When the number of paths is more than a constant, we provide two approximation schemes: first, under a regularity condition where paths have asymptotically equal lengths, we show the problem admits an approximation scheme which is fully polynomial. Second, for a general setting where the regularity condition does not necessarily hold, we provide another approximation scheme which runs in time polynomial in the size of the graph.},

  abstract = {Graph burning is a deterministic discrete time graph process that can be interpreted as a model for the spread of influence in social networks. The burning number of a graph is the minimum number of steps in a graph burning process for that graph. In this paper, we consider the burning number of graph products. We find some general bounds on the burning number of the Cartesian product and the strong product of graphs. In particular, we determine the asymptotic value of the burning number of hypercube graphs and we present a conjecture for its exact value. We also find the asymptotic value of the burning number of the strong grids, and using that we obtain a lower bound on the burning number of the strong product of graphs in terms of their diameters. Finally, we consider the burning number of the lexicographic product of graphs and we find a characterization for that.},

  abstract = {Graph burning is one model for the spread of memes and contagion in social networks. The corresponding graph parameter is the burning number of a graph G, written b(G), which measures the speed of the social contagion. While it is conjectured that the burning number of a connected graph of order n is at most ?n?, this remains open in general and in many graph families. We prove the conjectured bound for spider graphs, which are trees with exactly one vertex of degree at least 3. To prove our result for spiders, we develop new bounds on the burning number for path-forests, which in turn leads to a 32-approximation algorithm for computing the burning number of path-forests.},

  abstract = {La propagaci{\'o}n en grafos es un tema que ha sido bastante estudiado en los {\'u}ltimos a{\~n}os. Modela situaciones que podemos encontrar en la vida real como la propagaci{\'o}n de una noticia en las redes sociales, de una pandemia, de un incendio o de un virus, ya sea en un contexto biol{\'o}gico o inform{\'a}tico. Respecto a dicho tema, estudiamos dos tipos de problemas que reciben la denominaci{\'o}n de ?Firefighter Problem? y ?Burning Graph Problem?. El primer problema se describe como un modelo determinista en tiempo discreto de la propagaci{\'o}n de alguna de las situaciones descritas anteriormente en un grafo G=(V,A) pero con herramientas para controlar dicha propagaci{\'o}n, las cuales reciben el nombre de bomberos. Tiene como objetivo principal maximizar el n{\'u}mero de v{\'e}rtices salvados. ?Burning Graph Problem? es, tambi{\'e}n, un proceso determinista cuya finalidad es quemar todos los v{\'e}rtices lo antes posible. A diferencia del problema anterior, no cuenta con ninguna herramienta de control. Este Trabajo de Fin de Grado se ha dividido en dos partes: La primera, un resumen (tipo ?survey?), donde se han recopilado teoremas, lemas, corolarios y demostraciones sobre los dos problemas citados anteriormente. La segunda, un estudio algor{\'i}tmico y combinatorio en distintos tipos de grafos en ?Firefighter Problem? donde, adem{\'a}s, tambi{\'e}n se han estudiado par{\'a}metros importantes como el n{\'u}mero de supervivencia, la tasa y el m{\'i}nimo da{\~n}o esperado.---ABSTRACT---The propagation in graphs is a topic which has been studied during the last years. It models situations that can be found in real life, such as the spread of news on social media networks, pandemic, fire or virus, either in a biological or computer context. Regarding this topic, it will be studied two types of problems which receive the denomination of ?Firefighter Problem? and ?Burning Graph Problem?. The first problem is a deterministic, discrete-time model of the spread of any of the situations described above in a graph G=(V, A). However, it uses tools to control this expansion. These tools are firefighters. The main goal is saving the maximum plausible number of vertices. ?Burning Graph Problem? is a deterministic, discrete-time model whose purpose is burning all nodes as soon as possible. Unlike the previous problem, this has not any control instrument. This paper has been divided into two parts. Firstly, there is a summary (type ?survey?), where it has been collected theorems, lemmas, corollaries and proofs about the issues that have been gathered previously. Secondly, it can be found an algorithmic and combinatorial study in different kinds of graphs in the Firefighter Problem. Moreover, it has been studied important parameters, for instance, the surviving number, surviving rate, and the minimum expected damage.},

In each time step, a firefighter may be placed on an unburned vertex, permanently protecting it, and the fire spreads to all neighboring unprotected vertices of burning vertices. The goal is to let as few vertices burn as possible. In this paper, we consider a generalization of this problem, where at each time step b?1 firefighters can be deployed. Our results answer several open questions raised by Cai et al. [8]. We show that this problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of saved vertices, protected vertices, and burned vertices. We also investigate several combined parameterizations for which the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. Some of our algorithms improve on previously known algorithms. We also establish lower bounds to polynomial kernelization.},

We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others{\textquoteright} positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

E(K n) of initially 'infected' edges, we infect, at each time step, a new edge e if there is a copy of H in K n such that e is the only not-yet infected edge of H. We say that G percolates in the H-bootstrap process if eventually every edge of K n is infected. The extremal questions for this model, when H is the complete graph K r, were solved (independently) by Alon, Kalai and Frankl almost thirty years ago. In this paper we study the random questions, and determine the critical probability p c(n,K r) for the K r-process up to a poly-logarithmic factor. In the case r = 4 we prove a stronger result, and determine the threshold for p c(n,K 4).},

For discrete time steps, the heuristics determine which nodes (centers, hubs, vertices, users) should be alarmed (in other words, burned) and in which order, when afterwards each alarmed node alarms its neighbors in the network at the next time step. The goal is to minimize the number of discrete time steps (i.e., time) it takes for the alarm to reach the entire network, so that all the nodes in the networks are alarmed. The burning number is the minimum number of time steps (i.e., number of centers in a time sequence alarmed &ldquo;from outside&rdquo;) the process must take. Since the problem is NP complete, its solution for larger networks or graphs has to use heuristics. The heuristics proposed here were tested on a wide range of networks. The complexity of the heuristics ranges in correspondence to the quality of their solution, but all the proposed methods provided a significantly better solution than the competing heuristic.},

In bootstrap percolation, sites on an empty lattice are first randomly occupied, and then all occupied sites with less than a given number m of occupied neighbours are successively removed until a stable configuration is reached. On any lattice for sufficiently large m, the ensuing clusters can only be infinite. On a Bethe lattice for m>or=3, the fraction of the lattice occupied by infinite clusters discontinuously jumps from zero at the percolation threshold. From an analysis of stable and metastable ground states of the dilute Blume-Capel model (1966), it is concluded that effects like bootstrap percolation may occur in some real magnets.},

The burning process takes place in discrete rounds. In each round, a new fire breaks out at a selected vertex and burns it. Meanwhile, the old fires extend to their adjacent vertices and burn them. A burning schedule selects where the new fire breaks out in each round, and the burning problem asks for a schedule that burns all vertices in a minimum number of rounds, termed the burning number of the graph. The burning problem is known to be NP-hard even when the graph is a tree or a disjoint set of paths. For connected graphs, it has been conjectured [3] that burning takes at most {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lceil {\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}} {\backslash} {\backslash}rceil {\$}{\$} rounds.},

We show that, after sorting the input intervals by their endpoints, a data structure can be constructed sequentially in O(n) time and O(n) space; using this data structure, each query on the length of the shortest path between any two intervals can be answered in O(1) time, and each query on the actual shortest path can be answered in O(k) time, where k is the number of intervals on that path. Furthermore, this data structure can be constructed optimally in parallel, in O(log n) time using O(n/log n) CREW PRAM processors; each query on the actual shortest path can be answered in O(1) time using k processors. Our techniques can be extended to solving the all-pair shortest path query problem on circular-arc graphs, both sequentially and in parallel, in the same complexity bounds. As an immediate consequence of our results, we improve by a factor of n the space complexity of the previously best-known sequential all-pair shortest path algorithm for unweighted interval graphs. � 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {Many network problems are based on fundamental relationships involving time. Consider, for example, the problems of modeling the flow of information through a distributed network, studying the spread of a disease through a population, or analyzing the reachability properties of an airline timetable. In such settings, a natural model is that of a graph in which each edge is annotated with a time label specifying the time at which its endpoints “communicated.” We will call such a graph a temporal network. To model the notion that information in such a network “flows” only on paths whose labels respect the ordering of time, we call a path time-respecting if the time labels on its edges are non-decreasing. The central motivation for our work is the following question: how do the basic combinatorial and algorithmic properties of graphs change when we impose this additional temporal condition? The notion of a path is intrinsic to many of the most fundamental algorithmic problems on graphs; spanning trees, connectivity, flows, and cuts are some examples. When we focus on time-respecting paths in place of arbitrary paths, many of these problems acquire a character that is different from the traditional setting, but very rich in its own right. We provide results on two types of problems for temporal networks. First, we consider connectivity problems, in which we seek disjoint time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. The natural analogue of Menger's Theorem for node-disjoint paths fails in general for time-respecting paths; we give a non-trivial characterization of those graphs for which the theorem does hold in terms of an excluded subdivision theorem, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for connectivity on this class of graphs. (The problem on general graphs is NP-complete.) We then define and study the class of inference problems, in which we seek to reconstruct a partially specified time labeling of a network in a manner consistent with an observed history of information flow.},

The main result shows that the class of cographs (P4-free graphs) is WQO by ≤i, and that this is the unique maximal lower ideal with one forbidden subgraph that is WQO. This is a consequence of the famous Kruskal theorem. Modifying our idea we can prove that P4-reducible graphs build a WQO class. Other examples of lower ideals WQO by ≤i are also given.},

The recognition process works in two steps. First, we use partition refinement techniques to produce a factorizing permutation, i.e., an ordering of the vertices in which the strong modules appear consecutively. Then a very simple test algorithm is provided to check whether the given graph is a cograph, using a single sweep of the permutation obtained in the first step.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the split decomposition of graphs and give new combinatorial and algorithmic results for the class of totally decomposable graphs, also known as the distance hereditary graphs, and for two non-trivial subclasses, namely the cographs and the 3-leaf power graphs. Precisely, we give structural and incremental characterizations, leading to optimal fully dynamic recognition algorithms for vertex and edge modifications, for each of these classes. These results rely on the new combinatorial framework of graph-labelled trees used to represent the split decomposition of general graphs (and also the modular decomposition). The point of the paper is to use bijections between the aforementioned graph classes and graph-labelled trees whose nodes are labelled by cliques and stars. We mention that this bijective viewpoint yields directly an intersection model for the class of distance hereditary graphs.},

The splittance is seen to depend only on the degree sequence of the graph, and an explicit formula for it is derived. This result allows to give a simple characterization of the degree sequences of split graphs. Worst cases for the splittance are determined for some classes of graphs (the class of all graphs, of all trees and of all planar graphs).},

Given a vertex v and an integer i > 0, find the ith vertex on the path from v to the root. Given any m, 1 ≤ m ≤ log*n, we achieve the following results: (1) O(log(m) n)1 time using an optimal number of processors for preprocessing and constant time using a single processor for processing a query if m is constant. (2) O(log* n) time using an optimal number of processors for preprocessing and O(log* n) time using a single processor for processing a query. These results assume that the Euler tour of the tree and the level (distance from the root) of each vertex are given. Without these assumptions, the only change in result (1) above is that preprocessing time increases to O(log n). An immediate corollary is a serial linear-time bound for preprocessing and a constant-time bound for processing a query.1log(i) denotes the ith iterate of the log function (i.e., log(1) (n) = log n and log(i) (n) = log(log(i−1)(n)) for i ≥ 2). log* n = minimum {i|log(i)(n) ≤ 1}.},
